//! # Cargo `XTask`
//!
//! A collection of tasks to be executed with `cargo xtask`.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This module provides a comprehensive suite of tasks aimed at streamlining the development,
//! testing, and maintenance of Rust projects. It leverages `cargo xtask`, a convention for
//! creating and running custom cargo commands, enabling developers to extend Cargo's
//! capabilities and integrate additional tooling and workflows directly into their build process.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Documentation Generation**: Automate the creation of project documentation, ensuring
//!   consistency and completeness across all codebase components.
//!
//! - **Continuous Integration (CI) Tasks**: Implement a variety of CI tasks to validate code
//!   quality, run tests, and ensure the stability of the codebase.
//!
//! - **Dependency Analysis**: Analyze project dependencies for potential issues, outdated
//!   libraries, and opportunities for optimization.
//!
//! - **Development Workflow Enhancement**: Streamline the development workflow with tasks
//!   designed to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency.
//!
//! - **Customization**: Easily extend and customize tasks to suit the unique requirements of
//!   your project.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To use these tasks, you will need to have `cargo xtask` installed. Once installed, you can
//! run tasks using the following command:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo xtask <task-name>
//! ```
//!
//! Replace `<task-name>` with the name of the task you wish to execute. Each task may have its
//! own set of arguments and options, which can be discovered by running:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo xtask <task-name> --help
//! ```
//!
//! ## Contributing
//!
//! Contributions to enhance existing tasks or add new tasks are welcome. Please ensure that all
//! new tasks are well-documented and include appropriate error handling to maintain the
//! robustness of the tooling.
//!
//! ## License
//!
//! This collection of cargo xtasks is distributed under the terms of both the MIT license and
//! the Apache License (Version 2.0). See LICENSE-APACHE and LICENSE-MIT for details.
