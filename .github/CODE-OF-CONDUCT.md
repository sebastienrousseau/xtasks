## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Examples of Positive Behaviour

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of Unacceptable Behaviour

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project team at <contact@xtasks.pro>.

### Procedures

Upon receiving a report, the project team will review and investigate the allegations, taking the most appropriate action based on the severity of the issue, ranging from a warning to immediate removal from the project.

### Appeal

If you disagree with a decision and wish to appeal, please contact [another entity or person on the project] who was not involved in the action you are appealing against to discuss your concerns.

### Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflicts of interest in the enforcement of this code of conduct, the conflicted parties will recuse themselves from handling the report.

### Consequences

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

Updates
Updates to this Code of Conduct will be announced via [Platform], so community members are always aware of any changes.
